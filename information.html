<b>Patient Records</b>
<br>
Patient records, interview transcripts, medication lists, etc are all to be stored electronically and as 
paper-based records in individual files. The security and confidentiality of these records is of extreme 
importance as they may contain sensitive data relating to high profile professional athletes.
Any files or documents that are identified as containing patient information of a medical 
or personal nature are to be classified as “Confidential”.
Paper-based files should be stored in the filing cabinet that is clearly labelled “Confidential Patient 
Records” located in the Reception area. The cabinet should be locked when the Reception is 
unattended and the key located in the top drawer of the Reception desk.
Electronic copies of the records should be stored as Word documents in the folder marked 
“ClientDetails” located on the computer in the Reception area. This folder is not to be shared and 
can only be accessed from Reception. Individual folders should be created within this folder for each 
patient where possible. This folder should be backed up every week onto the USB drive located in the 
top drawer of the Reception desk.
Only managers, consultants and authorised external contractors should have access to these files as 
they are highly confidential. External contractors must obtain clearance from Ms Geraldine 
Brettingham-Roberts before accessing files marked as “Confidential” and be supervised at all times
